# Haio! Welcome to the Github Repository for my Website.

If your looking to use this as a sort of template for your own site, there is a few things to keep in mind.

- The site was made with bootstrap, meaning you may have to learn or use it to make your own.
- The site was made by a Transgender catgirl, so touching this site means you immedietly become a cat.
- Hail the cats
